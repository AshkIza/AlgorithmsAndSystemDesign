Tries, radix trees, suffix trees
http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2018/course/DAT037_Datastrukturer/slides/12-tries.pdf
A suffix tree is a radix tree that stores all suffixes of a given string
Example: suffixes of “catinthehat” are:
“catinthehat”, “atinthehat”, “tinthehat”, etc


Suffix Trees (a special Radix Tree, Radix Tree is a compressed Trie)
https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/advanced-data-structures/suffix-trees/tutorial/
"Suffix tree is a compressed trie of all the suffixes of a given string."
Suffix trees help in solving a lot of "string related problems" like
	 "pattern matching", 
	 finding distinct substrings in a given string,
	 finding longest palindrome

Ternary Search Tree (special Trie)
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ternary-search-tree/
A ternary search tree is a "special trie" data structure where
	 the child nodes of a standard trie are ordered as a 'binary search tree'.
Representation of ternary search trees:
	Unlike trie(standard) data structure where each node contains 26 pointers for its children, 
	each node in a ternary search tree contains only 3 pointers:
		1. The left pointer points to the node whose value is less than the value in the current node.
		2. The equal pointer points to the node whose value is equal to the value in the current node.
		3. The right pointer points to the node whose value is greater than the value in the current node.
    Apart from above three pointers, each node has a field to indicate data(character in case of dictionary) and 
    another field to mark end of a string.
	So, more or less it is similar to BST which stores data based on some order.
