 * You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street.
 *  Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of 
 *  them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact 
 *  the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house,
 determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
 
 Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
