 * Convert BST to Min Heap
Given a binary search tree which is also a complete binary tree.
 The problem is to convert the given BST into a Min Heap with the condition that 
 all the values in the left subtree of a node should be less than all the values in the right subtree of the node.
 This condition is applied on all the nodes in the so converted Min Heap.
