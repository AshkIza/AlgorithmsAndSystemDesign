Adaptor

Connecting new code to legacy -> without changing the existing contract (interface) that was produced from legacy code 
Converting a legacy interface into another interface. When one portion of our code is legacy code which we can not change.
Does NOT add any new functionality to the legacy api ( decorator patten does)
examples:
 +Arrays.asList() 
 +Streams adaptors :  list.stream()
Integer[] arrayOfInts = new Integer[]{1, 10, 100};
List<Integer> listOfInt = Arrays.asList(arrayOfInts);
